#Assignment: Create a responsive portfolio with images, internal linking & "about" "my work" "contact me" sections.

**Languages Used:** html & css
**I jazzed it up:** Hover effects with sizing, border & color transitions
**How I Made it Responsive:** Media Queries & Flex styling
**Internal Linking:** Added ID's to each section and referred the href to each individual id



[x] I can load portfolio
[x] I click one of the links in the navigation and jump to the section about their work
[x] I am presented with the developer's first application
[x] I click on the images of the applications
[x] I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

I noticed that my github link looks different than my live-server link. The fontsize is a bit bigger and the "About Me" heading gets pushed up to the "my work" section when browser shrinks.
